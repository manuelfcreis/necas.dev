            Hi, I&apos;m Manuel Costa Reis and this is my personal website.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>About me:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul className="summary">
            <li>I&apos;m currently a data scientist at Casafari.</li>
            <li>
              I have previously worked as a{" "}
              <strong>full-stack software developer</strong>, as an{" "}
              <strong>economist</strong> and I&apos;ve had my own start-up,
              dedicated to podcasts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data science</strong> is for me a mixture of both
              development and economics. I end up gravitating towards it as I
              enjoy both implementing products in code but also trying to use
              data as a source for making decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks - currently over 65
              days of recorded listening.
            </li>
            <li>
              I&apos;m very interested in music. I&apos;m always looking for new
              things, currently I&apos;m listening to a lot of spiritual jazz,
              city-pop and disco. I&apos;m also very into cinema, host a weekly
              cinema club and I keep trying to learn more about cinematography
              and general technique at my place.
            </li>
            <li>
              Besides all this reading ends up being one of my favorite
              activities. Both fiction and non-fiction. The best books I&apos;ve
              read recently are <em>East of Eden</em> by John Steinbeck,{" "}
              <em>What I talk when I talk about running</em> by Haruki Murakami,{" "}
              and <em>Other minds</em> by Peter Godfrey-Smith.
