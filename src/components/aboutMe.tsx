              I'm a{" "}
              full-stack software developer, data scientist, {" "}
              economist and I&apos;ve had my own start-up,

              <strong>Data science</strong> is for me a mixture of both
              development and economics. I end up gravitating towards it as I
              enjoy both implementing products in code but also trying to use
              data as a source for making decisions.

              I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks.

              I&apos;m very interested in music. I&apos;m always looking for new
              things. I&apos;m also very into cinema, host a weekly
              cinema club and I keep trying to learn more about cinematography and cinema history.

            <li>
              Besides all this reading ends up being one of my favorite
              activities. Both fiction and non-fiction. I try to vary between the two.
