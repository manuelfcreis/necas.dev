        I'm a
         
        full-stack software developer, data scientist, 
         
        economist and I've had my own start-up, dedicated to podcasts.

        <strong>
          Data science
        </strong>
         is for me a mixture of both development and economics. I end up gravitating towards it as I enjoy both implementing products in code but also trying to use data as a source for making decisions.

        I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks.

        I'm very interested in music. I'm always looking for new things. I'm also very into cinema, host a weekly cinema club and I keep trying to learn more about cinematography and cinema history.

        Besides all this reading ends up being one of my favorite activities. Both fiction and non-fiction. I try to vary between the two.
