      Hi, I'm Manuel Costa Reis and this is my personal website.

        About me:
      </strong>
    </p>

      <li>
        I'm currently a data scientist at Casafari.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have previously worked as a
         
        <strong>
          full-stack software developer
        </strong>
        , as an
         
        <strong>
          economist
        </strong>
         and I've had my own start-up, dedicated to podcasts.

        <strong>
          Data science
        </strong>
         is for me a mixture of both development and economics. I end up gravitating towards it as I enjoy both implementing products in code but also trying to use data as a source for making decisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks - currently over 65 days of recorded listening.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm very interested in music. I'm always looking for new things, currently I'm listening to a lot of spiritual jazz, city-pop and disco. I'm also very into cinema, host a weekly cinema club and I keep trying to learn more about cinematography and general technique at my place.
      </li>
      <li>
        Besides all this reading ends up being one of my favorite activities. Both fiction and non-fiction. The best books I've read recently are 
        <em>
          East of Eden
        </em>
         by John Steinbeck,
         
        <em>
          What I talk when I talk about running
        </em>
         by Haruki Murakami,
         
        and 
        <em>
          Other minds
        </em>
         by Peter Godfrey-Smith.
